# agentdeck

Linux-only manager for harness instances and accounts: Claude Code, Codex,
OpenCode and Antigravity (`agy`). One Rust binary holds the CLI, the iced GUI
and the usage polling daemon; the COSMIC panel applet is a separate binary.

What it does:

- Keeps a registry (`~/.config/agentdeck/instances.toml`) of harness
  instances, the model pool and quota sources; the CLI, GUI and daemon share
  it under a file lock.
- Polls usage quotas (5-hour, weekly and per-model windows, balances) in the
  background and publishes one `state.json` for the panel, the GUI and the
  router. Login happens only through the official CLIs inside agentdeck's PTY.
- Syncs shared state across instances: secondary accounts, Codex shadow
  homes, skills, instruction files, MCP lists, terminal wrappers.
- Ships built-in plugins with no standalone copies: usage polling, the model
  router and the agent-process supervisor.

## Install

```sh
cargo install --locked --path crates/agentdeck
```

Desktop entry (points at `agentdeck` on `PATH`):

```sh
install -m 0644 crates/agentdeck/agentdeck.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/
```

COSMIC applet (separate binary, libcosmic required):

```sh
cargo install --locked --path crates/agentdeck-applet
```

Then add **agentdeck** in the COSMIC panel settings. The applet reads the same
`state.json` the daemon publishes; no network calls, no credentials.

## CLI overview

```text
agentdeck instance      registry instances in instances.toml (list/add/remove)
agentdeck pool          [[pool]] model pool
agentdeck usage         [[usage]] quota sources (once/doctor/hooks plan)
agentdeck daemon        usage polling daemon (single writer)
agentdeck login <id>    official login CLI for an instance inside a PTY
agentdeck claude        sync and drift-check secondary Claude accounts
agentdeck codex         sync, check and fix Codex shadow homes
agentdeck opencode      show OpenCode accounts, switch the active one
agentdeck harness       detect binaries, run official updaters/installers
agentdeck t3            T3 providerInstances status, sync and import
agentdeck sync          background sync drift status and manual runs
agentdeck skills | instructions | mcp   shared skills, AGENTS.md links, MCP lists
agentdeck wrapper       per-instance terminal wrappers and .desktop launchers
agentdeck service       install/remove/inspect the systemd user unit (never starts it)
agentdeck plugin        enable/disable built-in plugins (agent-process, ai-usage, router)
agentdeck route         route a task through the router (route.mjs port)
agentdeck router        refresh the generated router.json
agentdeck ps            live agent-process tree (read-only)
agentdeck migrate       copy-only migration from the old ai-usage tree
```

Every write command has `--dry-run`; tests and experiments run on temp dirs.

The daemon is a systemd user unit, managed but never auto-started by
agentdeck itself:

```sh
agentdeck service install   # renders the unit, daemon-reload only
agentdeck service status
systemctl --user enable --now agentdeck-daemon.service   # owner's call
```

## GUI

The same binary serves the iced GUI (English and Russian): instances with
quotas, the add wizard with login, the drift view, the plugins page and the
processes page. The GUI shares the registry with the CLI under `flock` and
works while the daemon is stopped.

## Plugins

Built-in, enabled per machine with `agentdeck plugin enable <name>`:

- `ai-usage` — quota polling daemon unit, hooks and status-line integration.
- `router` — model pool JSON and the delegation router.
- `agent-process` — supervised background processes with the same CLI and
  registry as the standalone script it replaces.

Enable lays out exactly the plugin's files, hooks and instruction block;
disable removes them. Plugin data is kept.

## Migration from ai-usage

Step-by-step runbook: [`docs/MIGRATION.md`](docs/MIGRATION.md).

```sh
agentdeck migrate ai-usage --dry-run
agentdeck migrate ai-usage   # copy-only: ids, secrets, cooldowns
```
